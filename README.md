# Movie-CAM
In this paper, we revisit the class activation mapping (CAM) techniques [7], and
shed light on how it help in understanding movie scenario segmentation task. We
first propose the adaptive threshold strategy and several modified implementations
of CAM derived from its vanilla version that are suitable for a wide range of visual
explanation needs. Using a collected data set consisting of 30 movies with labeled
scenario segmentations, we apply CAM to visualize the discriminative regions in
the input sequential shots that determine whether there exist a scenario transition
between the consecutive two shots. The experimental results demonstrate that our
extended version of CAM provides novel perspective to understand movie scenario
segmentation task, and serves as an indicator of the potential limitations of our
current scenario segmentation approaches in order to bring future improvements.
